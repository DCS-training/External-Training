- [Visual AI and The Humanities An Introduction](https://tinyurl.com/EdinburghVAI)
Computer vision is one of AI's most visible success stories, and the subject of intense critical debate. This workshop showcased the state of the art in Visual AI for cultural heritage and the digital humanities, and provided a hands-on introduction to some simple techniques for searching and classifying imagery in books, paintings, photographs and film. 
Dr. Giles Bergel is a digital humanist based in the Visual Geometry Group in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. A book historian by training, he has research interests in the computational analysis of print culture, copyright and book trade history. He maintains various digital resources for the study of the book and the book trade: he is currently the inaugural National Librarian of Scotlandâ€™s Fellow in Digital Scholarship, working on a project on chapbooks printed in Scotland.
