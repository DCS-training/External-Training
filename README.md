## Library tools
- [Visual AI and The Humanities An Introduction](https://tinyurl.com/EdinburghVAI)
Computer vision is one of AI's most visible success stories, and the subject of intense critical debate. This workshop showcased the state of the art in Visual AI for cultural heritage and the digital humanities, and provided a hands-on introduction to some simple techniques for searching and classifying imagery in books, paintings, photographs and film. 
Dr. Giles Bergel is a digital humanist based in the Visual Geometry Group in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. A book historian by training, he has research interests in the computational analysis of print culture, copyright and book trade history. He maintains various digital resources for the study of the book and the book trade: he is currently the inaugural National Librarian of Scotland’s Fellow in Digital Scholarship, working on a project on chapbooks printed in Scotland.  

- [All things IIIF at the University of Edinburgh (debut: Deep Dive)](https://uoe-iiif.github.io/iiif/workshop)
The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) is a community-led approach to standardised image delivery. Its aims are to produce uniform, rich access to media wherever it is hosted; to produce APIs that support interoperability, and to produce tools that improve the user experience around viewing, comparing, manipulating, and annotating images. 
The Library and University Collections department at the University of Edinburgh have embraced IIIF, and are heavily invested in its use, as consortium members. In this workshop, Scott Renton and Mike Bennett will give an overview of the IIIF concepts, and Edinburgh's deployment and progress in the field, from simple image manipulation and deep zoom to search and annotation. There will be opportunities to get hands-on with the technology and to try things out for yourself.  


## Data Visualisation
- [Visualisation with R](https://andreskarjus.github.io/artofthefigure/cdcs2020/) 
This practical workshop served as an introduction to programmatic data visualization. Access to quality data has considerably improved in the humanities and social sciences, along with computational tools and resources to deal with big datasets. However, along with big data comes the question of how to make the information accessible – to the researcher looking at the data, to the reader of an academic paper that has made use of the data, but also to the media or the interested lay person browsing the website of a project.
This workshop teached participants the basics of R, an immensely powerful and flexible language for data analytics and visualization. We will quickly go through just enough of the programming and explorative data analysis basics before diving into a variety of graphs - for numeric, categorical, textual, and network data, starting with simple static plots and moving on to creating interactive, animatable, multifunctional figures.

## Text Analysis
- [Introduction to Text Analysis](https://learn.edina.ac.uk/intro-ta/)
The amount of textual data available to us grows each day, comprising a huge resource which is potentially of tremendous value. This workshop provided an introduction to the process of extracting meaningful structured data and information from text. 
In the attached tutorial you will be find instruction on how to use Python and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for the retrieval of basic textual information such as:Word frequencies,Plots of frequency distributions, Common word pairs, Part of Speech tagging 
The tutorial was created by David Elsmore from [Edina](https://edina.ac.uk/)

- [Further Text Analysis](https://learn.edina.ac.uk/inter-ta/)
Building on the work in the previous workshop (An Introduction to Text Analysis), this workshop introduced further techniques for analysing text. Using the Python programming language, participants explored sentiment analysis, N-grams, topic modelling, and data visualisation.

- [Introduction to Sentiment Analysis](https://learn.edina.ac.uk/sentiment/)
Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. Its use has become relatively widespread, including being used to analyse; customer feedback, social media, user surveys, and more. We will use the University’s Noteable web service and the Python programming language, but no previous programming experience will be required.
In this tutorial you can find: How Sentiment Analysis works, Pros and Cons, Sentiment Analysis of text, Analysing user feedback, Analysing Twitter

## Webscraping 
- [Webscraping news sites with Python](https://learn.edina.ac.uk/webscraping/) 
There is more information on the Internet than any individual can absorb in a lifetime. What is needed is not merely access to that information, but a scalable way to collect, organize, and analyse it.
Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website.
This workshop covered how to use Python to create a program to automatically retrieve and process information from a range of news sites and save this data in a structured format. This approach opens up a world of possibilities in data mining, data analysis, statistical analysis, and much more.

## Databases
- [Introduction to databases with SQLite](https://digital-exploits.edina.ac.uk/intro-db)
Managing data has become increasingly important in the Humanities and Social Sciences. Databases provide a powerful tool to allow for the storage, structuring and analysis of large amounts of data. In this workshop we will use SQLite, a flexible open-source database, to learn some of the basic concepts of database design and usage.
In this In this tutorial you can learn: Basic database design, Importing and exporting data, Querying datasets, Analysing your data
